Notes:
HOUR scale (per minute data)
 It seems to update about every 10 minutes, but the data is delayed by 7-20 minutes
 Once a timestamp is published it doesn't appear to be updated
 Pulling HOUR scale once per minute with current timestamp will drop data.  The data
 array moves on to the next hour but the previous hour hasn't been filled in yet.
 Recommend pulling now() and now()-1h every 5-10 minutes

DAY scale (per hour data)
 Updated once per hour for last hour, data is delayed 10-15 minutes
 Once a timestamp is published it doesn't appear to be updated
 Pulling with the current timestamp only will miss an hour at midnight.
 Recommend pulling once per hour at 15-20 past the hour, for now()-1h
 Possibly pull at 15 & 45 past the hour for backup

MONTH scale (per day data)
 A day's record is updated every hour (at the same time as the DAY scale hour is updated)
 Recommend pulling once per hour at 15-20 past the hour, for now()-1h
 Possibly pull at 15 & 45 past the hour for backup

YEAR scale (per month data)
 A month's record is updated every hour (at the same time as the DAY scale hour is updated)
 Recommend pulling once per hour at 15-20 past the hour, for now()-1h
 Possibly pull at 15 & 45 past the hour for backup


HOUR:
 Every 5 minutes for now()-15m (unless same hour)
DAY, MONTH, YEAR:
 Every 15,45 for now()-1h
